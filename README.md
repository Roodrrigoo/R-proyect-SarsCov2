# Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Sequences in Different Countries and Populations

This project, developed in **R**, aims to analyze SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported in the 20 countries with the most cases of COVID-19. The purpose is to answer key questions about the genetic diversity of the virus among different geographic regions and populations: **Asian, Hispanic, European, and African**. Using sequence analysis and graph generation tools, the project explores whether virus variants are significantly different between countries and populations.

## Main Objectives:
- Compare SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the most affected countries.
- Analyze the genetic variation of the virus and its relationship to geographic populations.
- Determine if there are characteristic mutations between variants circulating in different regions.

## Methodology:
- **Sequence analysis**: R was used to process the reported genetic sequences of the virus.
- **Phylogenetic tree**: A phylogenetic tree was constructed to visualize the evolutionary relationship between virus variants in different countries.
- **Graph interpretation**: Graphs were generated to visually interpret the results of the sequence analysis and evaluate differences in mutation load.

## Purpose of the Project:
The comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences between countries provides crucial information on the spread of the virus, its evolution, and the impact of genetic and environmental factors. This approach helps identify variants of concern and contributes to the development of improved diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.

## Tools:
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Techniques used**: Sequence analysis, construction of phylogenetic trees, data visualization with graphs.
